# Testing Plan

While in Testnet the fees are fixed and the output denomination is low. These will most likely change in the future.

The main purpose of testing is to try to get as many users to join in on rounds as possible to figure out bugs and bottlenecks. The denomination is low so that we have have more consecutive rounds while needing less Testnet Bitcoin.
